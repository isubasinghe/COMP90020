* Consensus
** Motivation
- Database transactions
- Leader Election
- Replicated State Machines
** Attempt to communicate and agree on the value of something

** Byzantine generals problem
- Several generals plan a coordinated attack from different directions
- Succeed only if all attack
- Fail if only some attack
- Each general has an initial opinion
- Can exchange information using messengers
- *Challenge:* messengers can be lost, or some generals can be treacherous.
** Problem formulation
- $G = (V, E)$ undirected graph
- Synchronous model. $|V|$ = n processes(called "nodes" here)
- Neighbouring nodes exchange messages (over multiple rounds)
- Each node set value of a decision variable $d_i$
*** Consensus condition (without failures):
- Termination: eventually each node sets its decision variable.
- Agreement: $d_i=d_j$ for all $i, j$
- Integrity/Validity: if $v_i = v$ for all $i$, then $d_i=v$ for all $i$.
*** Failure Model:
- Link failure: transmitted messages may never arrive at the destination.
- Process failure:
  - Stopping failure: node crashes after some rounds.
  - Byzantine failure: node can behave in arbitary ways
